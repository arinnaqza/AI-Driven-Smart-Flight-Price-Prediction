# AI-Driven Smart Flight Price Prediction

## Project Description ✈️ 

Flight tickets are one of the biggest financial concerns for international students who frequently travel between their home country and their study destination. Because airfare prices fluctuate due to multiple factors such as season, airline, and and departure schedule, students often struggle to find the best deals. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the fluctuations of flight ticket prices.

Using publicly available datasets on Kaggle, [Flight Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), the project will analyse how features like airline, number of stops, duration, departure and arrival time influence ticket costs. 

Unlike existing platforms such as Skyscanner that displays real-time ticket prices, this project focuses on understanding the underlying price patterns and forecasting future costs trends based on historical data. The results are expected to help international students identify the most cost-effective times to book flights and make more informed travel plans.
