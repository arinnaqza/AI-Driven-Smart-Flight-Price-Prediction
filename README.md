# AI-Driven Smart Flight Price Prediction

## Project Description ✈️ 

Flight tickets are one of the biggest financial concerns for international students who frequently travel between their home country and their study destination. Because airfare prices fluctuate due to multiple factors such as season, airline, and and departure schedule, students often struggle to find the best deals. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the fluctuations of flight ticket prices.

Using publicly available datasets on Kaggle, [Flight Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), the project will analyse how features like airline, number of stops, duration, departure and arrival time influence ticket costs. 

Unlike existing platforms such as Skyscanner that displays real-time ticket prices, this project focuses on understanding the underlying price patterns and forecasting future costs trends based on historical data. The results are expected to help international students identify the most cost-effective times to book flights and make more informed travel plans.

## I. Introduction

The motivation behind this project is to analyse real flight data and understand how ticket prices change as the departure date approaches. Instead of predicting exact prices, our goal is to uncover patterns between the number of days left before departure and the cost of the flight. By studying this relationship, we aim to identify which time windows typically offer cheaper prices and which periods see price spikes.

By the end of the project, we want to:

- Determine the optimal time frame to book flights based on historical patterns
- Visualize how prices behave as the departure date gets closer
- Provide insights that help international students make smarter booking decisions
- Build a machine learning model that learns from these patterns and predicts expected price trends

This project ultimately aims to offer practical, data-driven guidance that helps students save money and plan their travels more effectively.
