# AI-Driven Smart Flight Price Prediction

## Project Description

Flight tickets are one of the biggest financial concerns for international students who frequently travel between their home country and their study destination. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the fluctuations of flight ticket prices.

Using publicly available datasets on Kaggle, [Flight Price Prediction] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), ??? EDIT** the project will analyse how features like airline, number of stops, duration, and departure time influence ticket costs. 

Unlike existing platforms such as Skyscanner that displays real-time ticket prices, this project focuses on understanding the underlying price patterns and forecasting future costs based on historical data. The results are expected to help international students identify cost-saving periods and make more informed travel plans.
